In the quiet of the twilight, the sun takes its leave,
The world is bathed in colors, a sight to believe.
The stars begin to twinkle, like diamonds in the night,
A symphony of silence, the moon in soft light.

Whispers of the wind, through trees they softly flow,
Nature tells its stories, in a language we can know.
Rivers gently murmur, as they journey to the sea,
A dance of life unfolding, in quiet harmony.

The flowers in the meadow, nod their heads in grace,
Each petal a reminder, of nature's warm embrace.
Birds above in flight, their melodies a song,
A lullaby for the Earth, where they belong.

So let us take a moment, to listen and to see,
The beauty all around us, the simple mystery.
In every leaf and dewdrop, in every creature's call,
Nature weaves its poetry, a gift to cherish all.
